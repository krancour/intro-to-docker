# Hello, World!

Instead of doing something interactive, like we just did, now we can look at
something more closely resembling an application.

```console
$ docker run ubuntu:18.04 echo 'Hello, World!'
```

Conveniently, Docker has a pre-packaged `hello-world` image:

```console
$ docker run hello-world
```
